###### Looks smooth when you run it. Choppiness is because of GIF. 

## Requirements
* Python3
* [NumPy]
* [PyQtGraph]

### Usage
Modify the CONFIG section in main.py or run main.py as is. 

### Tasks
 - [x] Implement in 2D
 - [ ] Vectorize boid rules
 - [ ] Show directions of vectors on plot
 - [ ] Implement 'artificial' 2D boids
 - [ ] Implement in 3D with openGl
 - [ ] Implement 'artificial' 3D boids
